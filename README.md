# Vite ecosystem talk

This repository was created during and accompanies my talk at ViteConf '23 giving a tour of the Vite ecosystem. You can access it at https://github.com/benmccann/vite-ecosystem-demo.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
